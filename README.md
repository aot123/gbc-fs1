```language
Accoring to red rectangles in image #1:
#1. Display last price in USD and in BTC
#2. Display last block number, and time of the block creation
#3. Display total transactions of last block
#4. Toggle realtime update button. If it's enabled, it will automatically get data and update (if any) each 7 seconds
#5. Display percentage of price as rise/fall (b/c we don't have enough data to calculate it, we use mock data to show how it works, we create a random number: if it's even then the index is rise, it's fall if the number is odd)

Note: the chart beside is just an image.
